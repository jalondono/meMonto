            <p>Paula was partying with friends, she had a great time and now is time to get home. It is late in the night and she is concerned about the safety of her drive home.

After filtering for ratings she boards a taxi confidently knowing she get home safe.
                After getting home safely and comfortably she thanks the driver Pedro and gives him a 5 stars review and a thank you note for the professionalism with which he offered her the transportations service.

            <h2>Mario  (Public transport service user)</h2>
            <p>He is trying to get back home after a long night of work, he is the kitchen chef at a trendy restaurant. He hails a taxi in the street, the driver asks him where he is going, after he tell him, the answer is a denial of service, this direction was not “convenient” for the driver.  He is tired of that, transport is public service, and the denial of service although legally punishable is hardly enforced. He notes the vehicle plate and introduces the review in the app. He wishes himself and other users don’t have to get a no for an answer when they want to get home. </p>

            <p>She takes care of the shopper's overall experience, of which security is a big part. She hates to hear stories about shoppers being mishandled by the taxi drivers using the shopping mall collecting point. Together with the shopping mall administration they will require drivers using the collecting point to register in momonto.co (the plattform) and to undergo a background check and continuous monitoring. Drivers on return will get the shopping mall endorsement (badge).</p>
